Working with API's in React
============================

What is the role of React Developer?
Building effective User Interfaces

What are responsibilities?
- Designing Reusable Components
- Designing Services
- Consuming Services
- Communication with API
- Form Validations
- Configuring Forms for various Modules
- Implementing Routing
- Handling Security Issues in Application
        Cross Site Scripting Attacks [XSS]
        Request Forgery
        Injection Attacks
        CORS

                                     API's

1. What is Distributed Computing Architecture?
- Two applications running or 2 different mechines can share information.
- Two applications running or same mechine in 2 different process can share information.

2. What are the popular distributed computing technologies?
- CORBA
- DCOM
- RMI
- EJB
- Web Services
- Remoting

3. Communication Specifications
- SOAP
- REST
- JSON

4. API uses distributed computing architecture
    API comprises of
        a) Service Consumer
        b) Service Provider
    API communication is managed in 3 ways
        SOAP
        REST
        JSON

SOAP
- Service Oriented Architecture Protocol
- Consumer will make an XML request
- Provider will send an XML response

Ex:
    Request:
        <Product>
                <Id>2</Id>
        </Product>

    Response:
        <Product>
           <Id>2</Id>
           <Name>TV</Name>
           <Price> 45000 </Price>
        </Product>

REST[full]
- Representational State Transfer
- Consumer will make Query request
- Provider will respond with XML and optionally JSON.

Request:
      http://fakestoreapi.com/products?id=2

Response
        <Product>
           <Id>2</Id>
           <Name>TV</Name>
           <Price> 45000 </Price>
        </Product>

JSON:
- JavaScript Object Notation
- Consumer make JSON request
- Provider will response with JSON

Request:
    {
     "Id" : 2
    }

Response
    {
     "Id":2,
    "Name":"TV",
    "Price":45000
    }

Design End Point
- Provider
        MongoDB         Database
        Node.js            Server
        Express            API
       
- Consumer
        React                 UI
        - fetch()
        - $.ajax()
        - axios
        - whatwg-fetch


                                 MongoDB Database
                                -----------------------------
1. Download and Install MongoDB Database Server on your PC

    https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Note: Make sure that you selected "MongoDB Compass", which is
        a GUI tool for working with database.

2. Open MongoDB Compass

3. Connect with MongoDB Server using

        "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"

     Oracle, MySql                    MongoDB
     Database                        Database
     Table                            Collection
     Records                            Documents
     Fields                            Fields
     Joins                                Embedded Documents
                                        [JSON]

4. Create a new Database

        database name        : reactdb
        collection name        : tblusers

5. Insert document into table [collection] => Add Data => Insert Document

{
  "UserId":"shivam150",
  "UserName": "Shivam",
  "Password": "Shivam@234",
  "Age":22,
  "Mobile": "+91923832422",
  "Subscribed":true  
}

                            Server Side API
                        [Node.js and Express]

GET            /getusers                    
GET            /getusers/userid
POST           /registeruser

    http://localhost:port/getusers

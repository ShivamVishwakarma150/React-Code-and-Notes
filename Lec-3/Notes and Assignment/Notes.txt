Chap 03 :- Laying the foundation
=================================

Pollyfill
----------
-> to make older browser understand our new code, the new code is converted into a older code which can understand called pollyfill.

-> Babel do this conversion automatically.
Eg:- ES6 is the newer version of javascript.
If i'am working with 1999 browser.
my browser will not understand what is this const,newPromise etc.
so, there is a replacement code for these functionalities which is compatible with older version browsers.

-> so, this is what happen when we write "browserlist" -> owr code is converted to older version.

Babel
-----

-> is a javascript package/library used to convert code written in newer versions of JS (ECMAScript 2015,2016,2017 etc) into code that can be run in older JS Engines.

To run our app, command is :-

npx parcel index.html

we always don't have to write this command. Generally we build a script inside package.json which runs this command in easy way.

package.json
------------
"scripts":{
    "start":"parcel index.html"
    "test":"jest"
}

So, to tun the project, I've to use :-
npm run start 
shortcut :- npm start 

"start" script execute by this command.

Build command
-------------

npx parcel build index.html
----------------------------

"scripts":{
    "build":"parcel build index.html"
}

Note :-
-------

npx = npm run 
so, npm run build will build a project.


-------------------------------------------------------------------


Console logs are not removed automatically by parcel. you have to configure your projects to remove it.

-> there is a package which helps to remove console logs :-
Babel-plugin-transform-remove-console
